            Summary:

            Problem
            As a research and advocacy organization, the Society for Women’s Health Research (SWHR) needs to demonstrate its thought leadership in the field of women’s health. Due to staff turnover and the normal changes in organizational directions, SWHR has had a number of people working on their website over the years. As the online home for all SWHR research and past policy initiatives, the organization needs the site to present a well-organized system for anyone looking for relevant resources. With so many cooks in the kitchen, they have stored resources in various places over the years, and the information architecture of the site had lost a unified sense of organization.

            Approach
            Discovery
            I created a kick-off agenda for the first meeting, and led a brief activity for early discovery. We asked the SWHR stakeholders:
            What is the main point of the site?
            Who are your users?
            What are your current pain points with the site?
            As a designer who is also focused on strategy and understanding user goals, it was important for me to help the SWHR stakeholders articulate their needs, and help them understand where their needs as an organization overlap with the needs of their users
            Following the kick-off meeting, we performed an affinity mapping exercise to group the pain points described by the organization staff. These included:
            Navigation
            Content
            Branding
            Functionality
            Our team also worked to identify the existing assets that the SWHR team uses to shape their content and editorial style
            User Research
            Our team developed a questionnaire to determine user frequency, competitor site use, and main user needs. With my background in non-profit communications, I was able to shape the language on questions surrounding site use and defining user needs
            I compiled Google analytics data from the SWHR communications lead to better understand the essential features and information on the site. I was interested to learn that the SWHR user base actually had a low bounce rate, despite the concerns from the organization about their information architecture and resource disarray. I also highlighted top pages, returning users, and referral traffic for the organization.

            Persona Development
            Our team built out personas based on our understanding of the main site users. While our research focused mainly on internal stakeholders, we used our understanding of the organization to create a proto persona representing many of the site’s ideal user goals. The personas highlighted potential pain points for the SWHR internal audience, and gave a human face to the user we were designing for.

            Information Architecture and Site Navigation
            One of the main needs we heard in our stakeholder and user interviews was for improved site navigation and content organization. To better understand the organization of the SWHR site structure, I first mapped the many pages of the site with the XML Sitemap tool xml-sitemaps.com. The team also created a visual sitemap for the existing site. We noted where content was organized, and where the system had broken down, with documents stored haphazardly.
            After spending a few weeks poring through the SWHR site and archives, we then used card sorting to build consensus on the navigation items. Using the tool Proven By Users, we culled multiple organization systems into one approach. Finally, we built a new recommended site map according to the information dendrogram that emerged from our card sort. While our final site map did not diverge dramatically from the existing site map, we highlighted where certain sub-menu items were repetitive or misnamed and made recommendations based on the organization’s stated messaging goals. For example, the original sitemap included resources under the science, advocacy, and events menu items. We encouraged the organization to rename “Advocacy” to “Policy” to better match stated needs, and to move the resources to their own independent section. With more time, I would have liked to have developed a proper taxonomy for resource tagging and organization, as well as a filtering system for the resource library
            We also looked at the utility navigation, and used information from stakeholder and user interviews to focus in on what mattered most
            Wireframes
            We made some wireframes.
            I created the homepage wireframe and set the over arching organizational framework for the site

            Style Guide
            The organization already had commissioned print design standards, but had not interpreted these for use on the web. I provided web font recommendations and fallbacks for the web style guide. I also used existing color associations to find the right use of color for the web.
            Other recommendations for future exploration include “chunking” content into easily digestible sections, and organizing content on pages with the most
            High-Fidelity Prototypes
            Our team created multiple high-fidelity mockups of the new site, updating page templates with our suggested style guide, site structure and navigation.
